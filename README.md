# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset to identify the key factors that influenced passenger survival using Python.

## Objective
To analyze the Titanic dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and understand how features like age, gender, class, and fare influenced survival rates.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Tasks
- Loaded and cleaned the Titanic dataset.
- Handled missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked).
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to explore patterns.
- Visualized survival trends based on gender, age group, passenger class, and fare.
- Derived actionable insights based on historical data.

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class had a better chance of survival compared to those in 2nd and 3rd class.
- Younger passengers (especially children) were more likely to survive.
- Passengers who paid higher fares had slightly better survival ch
## Project Files

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter.
3. Run all cells in sequence to explore and understand the analysis.
